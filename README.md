The Euler grid establishes Euler grid to work with. Then Opertaors contain all the operators viz. gradient and Laplacian operators to be applied on PDEs. Immersedbnd establishes the boundary or the Lagrangian coordinates to work with. Then IBM_project file contains the example where all these files are applied.
